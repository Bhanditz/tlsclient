// Connection represents an association with a TLS peer. Initially the peer is
// unknown and unauthenticated. As the association progresses, by reading and
// writing data, the peer's certificate will become known and application level
// data can be transmitted and received.
//
// This library does no verification of the server. It's up to the user of this
// library to wait until the server's certificate chain is available and to
// validate it before sending or receiving application level data.
//
// The object is not thread-safe.
//
// A Connection generates data to be sent in one of two ways: either the data
// is generated internally and is overhead of the TLS protocol, or the data is
// encrypted application level data. Whenever internally generated data needs
// to be sent, |need_to_write| will return true. There are no external signals
// into this object, so |need_to_write| can only become true after data from
// the peer has been passed to |Process|. Thus the users of this object should
// check |need_to_write| after every chunk of data has been processed.
//
// Application level data is encrypted on request (once
// |is_ready_to_send_application_data| is true) with |Encrypt| and the user of
// this object should immediately send the resulting data onwards. Data from
// |Get| and |Encrypt| must not be reordered.
//
// Don't forget to call EnableDefault (or some set of Enable calls) first.
